Hello, I am Huy Nghiem. I am a first-year doctoral student at the Univeristy of Maryland, College Park under the advise of [Dr. Hal Daum√© III](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/). Before joining UMD, I obtained my Master's degree at the [University of Southern California](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) under the guidance of [Dr. Emilio Ferrara](https://www.cs.usc.edu/), [Dr. Goran Muric](https://www.linkedin.com/in/goranmuric),  and [Dr. Fred Morstatter](https://fredzilla.github.io/). I also worked simultaneously with the [Children's Data Network](https://www.datanetwork.org/) at the USC's School of Social Work. My research interests include Interpretability, Fairness and Equity of Machine Learning systems, particularly of multi-modal models. I aspire to leverage my research to social complex social problems.


I enjoy music, sci-fi thrillers and manga. While I am not reading, you can find me walking along scenic trails, soaking in nature.
